# Crafting interpreters

is [a book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) that I'm reading

## rulox
is my rust version of the Lox interpreter outlined in the book (originally implemented in Java)

## unrulox
is the same but using unsafe rust instead of c

## execution

cargo run 

should make two binaries, one for rulox and another for unrulox (once implemented).
