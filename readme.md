# Crafting interpreters

is a book I'm reading

## rulox
is my rust version of the Lox interpreter outlined in the book (originally implemented in Java)

## unrulox
is the same but using unsafe rust instead of c

### compilation

```cargo
    cargo build 
```

should make two binaries, one for rulox and another for unrulox (once implemented).
